# Aegisub Tools
Aegisub Has many tools as we know but not for Arab Fansubbers, So we created these tools to make it easier for them.

## Tools
- JPTL - Translate From `eng, jp` to `ar, eng`.
- CR - Add Tachkeel To the selected lines `Arabic only`.
- Calculate Progress - Based on the number of `current line, all lines`.
- Fix Punctuation - fix the `. ! ØŸ` and make them at the end of the line In `RTL`.
- Remove str - remove line break `\N` from the selected line.
- Remove symbol - remove `!`" from the selected line.
- Remove Period - remove `.` at the end of the selected line.
- Swap clip - Swap clip from `LTR` to `RLT` or the opposite, (you can do it manual anyways).
- Adawet - All in one tools.
